# Ramsey-Graph-Game

### Welcome to the Ramsey Graph Game!

In this game, two players take turns coloring edges in a randomly generated graph. The goal is to create a monochromatic complete subgraph of a given size before the other player does.

# Rules

The Ramsey Graph Game is a two-player game played on a complete graph with n vertices. Each player takes turns coloring an uncolored edge of the graph in their own color. The first player colors edges with red, and the second player colors edges with blue.

The game ends when either:

* One player creates a monochromatic triangle (a set of three vertices connected by edges of the same color), in which case they win.

* All edges are colored and no player has created a monochromatic triangle, in which case the game is a tie.

<br />
It is important to note that the winning clique size and the number of vertices in the graph can be chosen by the players at the beginning of the game. This allows for flexibility and customization in gameplay. Enjoy playing and have fun exploring different strategies!
